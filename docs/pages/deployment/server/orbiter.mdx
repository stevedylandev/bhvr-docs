Much like the [inspiration](/why-bhvr) behind bhvr, [Orbiter](https://orbiter.host) is a site hosting platform built on the principles that the web should be open and without walled gardens. It features many of the things every dev wants:

- Simple CLI for local builds and deployments
- Custom Domains
- Analytics
- Version Control for easy rollbacks
- GitHub actions for automated deployments
- Serverless Functions

In this guide we'll show you how to deploy your [`server`](/packages/server) to Orbiter Functions.

## Server Deployment

::::note
Orbiter Functions are only available on paid plans. [Upgrade today!](https://app.orbiter.host/billing)
::::

### Quickstart

If you haven't already created your bhvr app you can quickly create one using the Orbiter CLI

::::steps

#### Setup Orbiter Account

Visit [app.orbiter.host](https://app.orbiter.host) to create an account and make an API key on the [App Dashboard](https://app.orbiter.host) or on the [Keys Page](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys).

#### Install the Orbiter CLI and Authorize

```bash [terminal]
bun add -g orbiter-cli@latest
```

```bash [terminal]
orbiter auth
```

#### Create a New bhvr Project

Orbiter includes a special version of bhvr that has everything you need to have a fullstack app

```bash [terminal]
orbiter new --template bhvr
```

This will automatically install, build, and deploy the client and server packages of your bhvr project!

#### Deploy

Whenever you need to upload, simply run any of the `deploy` commands

```bash [terminal]
bun run deploy:client
bun run deploy:server
bun run deploy # Deploys both client and server
```

::::

### Manual Setup

Follow this guide if you already have an existing bhvr project you want to deploy to Orbiter

::::steps

#### Setup Orbiter Account

Visit [app.orbiter.host](https://app.orbiter.host) to create an account and make an API key on the [App Dashboard](https://app.orbiter.host) or on the [Keys Page](https://app.orbiter.host/api-keys).

#### Install the Orbiter CLI and Authorize

```bash [terminal]
bun add -g orbiter-cli@latest
```

```bash [terminal]
orbiter auth
```

#### Update Export Format

Update the code inside `server/src/index.ts` to use the export format required by Orbiter Functions:

```typescript [server/src/index.ts]
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { cors } from 'hono/cors'
import type { ApiResponse } from 'shared'

const app = new Hono()

app.use(cors())

app.get('/', (c) => {
  return c.text('Hello Hono!')
})

app.get('/hello', async (c) => {

  const data: ApiResponse = {
    message: "Hello BHVR!",
    success: true
  }

  return c.json(data, { status: 200 })
})

export default app; // [!code --]
export default { // [!code ++]
  async fetch(request: Request, env: any, ctx: any) { // [!code ++]
    return app.fetch(request, env, ctx) // [!code ++]
  } // [!code ++]
}; // [!code ++]
```

#### Deploy Server

Move into the `server` package and run the deploy command with the server flag:

```bash [terminal]
cd server

orbiter deploy --server
```

This will:
- Ask which site you want to link the server to (you must already have a client site deployed on Orbiter)
- Ask for the entry path for your server code (typically `src/index.ts`)
- Ask for your desired build folder (typically `dist`)
- Save your preferences to an `orbiter.json` file
- Build and bundle your server code
- Deploy it to Orbiter

If successful, you'll see a returned URL where you can access your API!

::::

## Environment Variables

If you need to use environment variables in your server, create a `.env` file with your values, then include the `--env` flag when deploying:

```bash [terminal]
orbiter deploy --server --env
```

This will automatically scan your `.env` file and include the variables in the deployment. Orbiter will never be able to see your variables, so make sure they are correct!

::::tip
You can also edit environment variables inside the [Orbiter App](https://app.orbiter.host)
::::

## GitHub Actions

You can set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your server whenever you push to your main branch.

Create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml` file in the root of your project:

```bash [terminal]
mkdir -p .github/workflows && touch .github/workflows/deploy.yaml
```

Paste the following code into the `deploy.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: "Deploy to Orbiter"

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Bun
        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
        with:
          bun-version: latest

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: bun install

      - name: Deploy to Orbiter
        env:
          ORBITER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ORBITER_API_KEY }}
        run: bunx orbiter-cli@latest deploy-server --siteId YOUR_SITE_ID --entryFile src/index.ts --buildDir dist
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual site ID, which can be found by clicking the "ℹ" icon on the [Orbiter dashboard](https://app.orbiter.host).

You'll need to add your Orbiter API key as a repository secret. Navigate to GitHub project Settings > Secrets and Variables > Actions. Click `New repository secret`, then use `ORBITER_API_KEY` as the name, and paste your API key into the box below.
